# Summary #

The summary report displays the progress of each project. Counting the number
of total tasks and completed tasks for each project. By default it only shows
the projects with active tasks, but by adding the flag `--all` then all
projects are shown. The same global report options apply aswell.

The output of the summary report follows this format:

```
Project Name, Remaining Tasks, Total Tasks, Average Age of Tasks, Completed
Tasks, Bar graph showing completion
```
