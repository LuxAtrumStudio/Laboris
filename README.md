# Laboris

> Task and time tracker and manager utility

Laboris is primarily a task tracker/manager, which has also incorporated time
tracking of the tasks. The aim of Laboris is to simplify the effort that is
expended in prioritizing tasks, and keeping track of what needs to be done.
Then on top of that it helps in tracking the progress on a task, by tracking
the time spent on any given task. 

Laboris is created with support for pip3, and can be installed with

```fish
pip3 install -e .
```

And requires Python3 to run properly.
